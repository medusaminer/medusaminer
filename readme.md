Medusa Miner 0.1.0

======================
About Medusa Miner
======================
Medusa Miner is a lightweight multi-algorithm crypto coin miner, it has been designed to be an 'all in one' that supports GPU's and ASICS alike. 
This takes the confusion out of choosing a miner when you are new to the crypto currency world.

We are trying to make a full featured miner with your help and suggestions. If you have any suggestions please contact Archiwall on litecointalk.org or email medusaminer@gmx.co.uk

You may notice we have used alot of drivers from CGMiner, This is to save time to rewrite what has already been done.

======================
Changes in 0.1.0
======================
+ Complete Rewrite of program for speed and stability.
+ 64-Bit Compatability
+ Support for medusa's own style config file. INI style - Recommended Use
+ Support for SGMiner/CGMiner Configs
+ More documentation (This has been lacking, sorry)

+ Support for Growl/Prowl/WSM/email to receive messages if hardware failure (Looking to add SMS to that list)

======================
Notes
